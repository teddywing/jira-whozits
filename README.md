Jira Whozits
============

A Google Chrome browser extension that adds ids to team member headers on the
scrum board.

In a large team, this makes it faster to navigate to a team member's section of
the board and stories, allowing you to jump directly to that section instead of
having to scroll through the entire board to find it.


## Usage
Append the name of a team member to the URL removing any spaces:

	https://some-company.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5&selectedIssue=SC-1000#PhilipJFry


## Installing
Download the .crx file from the [releases][0] page. Drag and drop the file into
the Chrome Extensions page.
